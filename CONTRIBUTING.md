# Contributing to the Gluster operator

## Workflow

Have an idea or feature request? [Use the template to open an issue.](https://github.com/gluster/operator/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

Found a bug? [There's a template for that, too.](https://github.com/gluster/operator/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

### Prioritization

Features and bugs should start as issues, using the appropriate templates. They
will be triaged and prioritized into the appropriate backlog on [the project
dashboard](https://github.com/gluster/operator/projects/1).

When items meet the "definition of ready" and have bubbled to the top of the
backlog, they can be marked as in-progress and have a person assigned.

#### Definition of Ready

- The task's user value is clearly articulated
- Task is small enough to be completed in a reasonable amount of time
- Clear acceptance criteria are defined

### Managing ongoing work

One goal of a Kanban style approach to development is limiting the amount of
work in progress. This ensures items move through the system quickly as well as
allowing maximum scheduling flexibility. To limit WIP, a developer should have
no more than two (2) issues in-progress at a time.

Issues/PRs can be closed/merged (and moved to the done column) once they meet
the "definition of done."

#### Definition of Done

- Acceptance criteria is met
- Documentation (both user-facing and design) is complete
- Tests are complete, automated, and passing
- All artifacts are merged
